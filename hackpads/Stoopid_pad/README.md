## Stoopid_Pad:

I had a lot of fun making the macropad, this was my first time making a PCB, though I found it more difficult to finish off the case because I have zero experience CADding and my potato laptop did not enjoy my attempts to import the pcb with keys and everything into OnShape. I was dreading the PCB part but it was surprisingly fun :D
